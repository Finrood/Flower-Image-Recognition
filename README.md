This Python project implements a flower image classifier using a neural network built with TensorFlow. The goal of this project is to classify images of different types of flowers into categories such as Gerbera, Iris, Lilac, Orchid, Daisy, Dandelion, Jonquil, Rose, Tulip, and Sunflower.

## Neural Network Architecture

The neural network architecture used in this project consists of multiple layers, including convolutional layers for feature extraction and fully connected layers for classification. The model is trained using a labeled dataset of flower images.

## Features

- Loading and preprocessing of flower image data.
- Neural network model construction using TensorFlow's Keras API.
- Training the model on the flower dataset.
- Evaluating the model's performance on a test dataset.
- Classifying new flower images using the trained model.
